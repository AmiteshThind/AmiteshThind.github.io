										<h2>About Me</h2>
										
									</header>
									<p>I am currently in my 3rd year of Computer Engineering and Society at McMaster. You may be wondering what is Engineering and Society? Well I’d love to explain as this something a lot of people find intriguing. The society aspect of my program revolves around learning about ways engineers can affect the community around them and be proactive in a sustainable manner.We work closely with the local community to ensure that as engineers we are able to create a positive impact within our society. 
									
									I chose this path because I am deeply passionate about technology and social justice.A long term goal that I am constantly striving for is to use my knowledge and aspiration for technology to create a positive impact on society. 


									</p>

									<p>
										

This past summer I worked as an IT Analyst at Rogers Communications which exposed me to the technical and business aspects of a workplace. By working on a IT project at Rogers I was constantly working with different individuals from different departments on a day to day basis. This helped hone not only my programming skills but also my communication, teamwork and leadership skills.

									
	

As an individual I am constantly striving for greatness and I hope that in this path that life takes me, I continue to meet great individuals whose experiences and wisdom I can learn from to make the impact I desire.

												<h4>Eco Bin</h4>
												<p>

By using the Google Cloud Vision API, Python and an Ardunio I created an automated waste management system that detects what type of waste has been inserted in the bin. The bin then dumps the waste in the recycling or garabge bin, depending on what it is found to be.
