						<h2>About Amitesh</h2>

					</header>
					<p>
						I am deeply passionate about technology and social justice. In our society we face challenges,
						but also tremendous opportunities to harness technological innovations to advance progress on
						social causes. A long term goal that I am constantly striving for is to use my knowledge and
						aspiration for technology to create a positive impact on society.
						Furthermore, I am fascinated by the principles of design thinking and I believe that it is vital
						to assess a problem from a holistic perspective in order to design effective and enduring
						solutions.


					</p>

					<p>

						In regards to my professional expereince, I have worked as a Full Stack Developer Intern, a web3
						Front End Engineer and am currently working as a Software Engineer. I enjoy
						building and maintainng frameworks and working on teams where I can create meaningful work.
						Furthermore, when I am not at work, you can find me contributing to on side
						projects. Currently, I am working on a web3 project as I beleive web3 has the potential to
						create an internet economy where end users are put at the forefront of decsions.
						In adddition, currently im developing a project that aims to empower and gamify the process of
						learning and teaching online. There are many hardships that I have faced when it comes to
						developing this Dapp, but the
						reward of being able to overcome them, keeps pushing me forward.



					</p>
					<p>

						In conclusion, I am someone who is constantly striving to create an everlasting impact within my
						teams,communities and the projects that I work on. I hope that in this path that life takes me
						on, I continue to meet great individuals whose experiences and wisdom I can learn from to make
						an everlasting positive impact.
